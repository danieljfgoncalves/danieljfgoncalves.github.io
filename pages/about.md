Hello, I'm Daniel from Porto, Portugal. 

I'm an almost graduated informatics engineer, currently looking for an academic internship in the Port Region.

I’ve done a few things in my still short career, and have finally pursued one of my passions: **software development**.

PS: My passions are: Soccer, GoT, Coding, My Dog 🐶, travelling ✈️, Coffee ☕ ...
